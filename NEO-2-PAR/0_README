1. Copy the file
   ProjectConfig.cmake.sample
   to
   ProjectConfig.cmake.in
   and edit the file for custom settings.

2. Have a look at the file
   CMakeLists.txt
   to understand how the project is built.

3. Enter the directory 
   Build-Release
   and run
   cmake ..
   (The two dots are required to do an out-of-source build)

4. Run
   make && make install
   to build an install the project.

The out-of-source build method gives to ability to create new build directories for different compilers and configurations, without affecting other build configurations.
The compiler can be change in step 3 by running
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc ..
instead of
cmake ..

Note that if you do not use a compiler that is shipped with the
distribution, but was compiled by the administrator, it might be
necesserary to also change the library search path.
E.g.

cmake -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-7.3.0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..

might require to set

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/afs/itp.tugraz.at/opt/gcc/7.3.0/arch-amd64/lib64/

in your ~/.bashrc
