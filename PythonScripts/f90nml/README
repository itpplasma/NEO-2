Usage:

You need to import the module

  import f90nml.parser

then create an parser object

  parser = f90nml.parser.Parser()

which is then used to read in a fortran namelist file

  nml = parser.read('neo2.in.ql-full')

A namelist can be acessed via their name

  nml['settings']

and the same holds for the entries for reading or setting the values

  nml['settings']['sparse_talk'] = True
