\section{Introduction}
This is document is a collection of notes to continue the work on the
ECCD and bootstrap tasks. It is not a document describing physical
aspects but technical details.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Technical background on NEO-2}
\subsection{Overview}
In the last years the development of NEO-2 has split into two branches,
namely the more general branch for stellarators (and axisymmetric
tokamaks) and the quasilinear version for tokamaks with 3D magnetic
perturbations. The main differences between these two versions at time
of writing this document is given in the following Table~\ref{tab:neo2branches}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Internal name   & NEO-2-PAR & NEO-2-QL\\
Equilibrium     & Tokamak/Stellarator & Non-axisymmetric tokamak\\
Multispecies    & No & Yes\\
Relativistic    & Yes & Yes (but not for multispecies)\\
Parallelization & Yes (field line) & Yes (Species)\\
Solver          & $1^\mathrm{st}$ Order & $1^\mathrm{st}$ and $2^\mathrm{st}$ Order\\
Distribution function & Yes & No (planned)
\end{tabular}
\caption{NEO-2 branches}
\label{tab:neo2branches}
\end{table}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Git repository}
Since 2013 the general version of NEO-2 is under Git version control.
Later, also the quasilinear version was added to this repository
including its code history. The official repository is located on github:
\begin{verbatim}
https://github.com/itpplasma/NEO-2/
\end{verbatim}
At the moment it is set to private, which means you need to be logged in
to be able to see it.

In order to start a new local working copy, it is required to do
\begin{verbatim}
git clone git@github.com:itpplasma/NEO-2.git .
\end{verbatim}
in an empty directory (do not oversee the point at the end of the
command line which defines the current directory).

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{CMake}
The build system of NEO-2 is CMake (since 2012). The main advantage is
that this build system takes care of correct compilation order of the
source files (dependency resolving) and that routines can be defined to
automatically detected the installed libraries. The configuration file
is called \verb|CMakeLists.txt|. Using CMake the source- and
build-directories can be separated from each other, and neo-2 requires
that this is done. In order to build
the source code it is necessary to create a build-directory, if not
already provided from the Git clone. For reasons of readability it was
decided to put the source files to be compiled in a separate file,
called \vv{CMakeSources.in}. Additionaly, some of the settings for paths
are in a separate file, \vv{ProjectConfig.cmake.in}. These files are
then included in \vv{CMakeLists.txt}.

For testing purposes a build-directory is now created for the general
version of NEO-2:
\begin{verbatim}
cd NEO-2-PAR
mkdir Build-Test
cd Build-Test
cmake ..
make
\end{verbatim}

Running the command \verb|cmake ..| is only necessary the first time a
new build directory is used. This command needs to know where
\verb|CMakeLists.txt| is located (therefore the \verb|..|). A lot
happens when this command is called, the most important steps are the
Fortran compiler and library detection. A standard Makefile is generated
which can be tested by running \vv{make}.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Libraries}
NEO-2 depends on a number of external libraries. While during the last
years some bleeding edge features of some of the libraries where used
and thus it was necessary to build these libraries locally, with
Debian 9 it was decided to change over to library versions distributed
with Debian. This makes maintenance considerably easier. The libraries
are:
\begin{itemize}
\item SuiteSparse
\item Metis
\item SuperLU
\item GSL
\item FGSL
\item HDF5 (interfaced via hdf5tools)
\item OpenMPI (interfaced via MyMPILib)
\item libneo
\end{itemize}

SuiteSparse is used for solving the sparse linear system of differential
equations in the ripple solver. Metis is used by SuiteSparse for speedup
of some specific routines and is not obligatory. SuperLU can be used
instead of SuiteSparse by a switch in the input file.

The GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) and its Fortran Interface FGSL are used
for several purposes. The first one provides very efficient numerical
integration methods used for the computation of the matrix elements of
the collision operator in \verb|collop_compute.f90|. Additionally, GSL
provides B-spline routines, also used for the collision operator module
(basis functions). While writing this document FGSL is not distributed
with Debian, therefore this is build locally in \verb|/proj/plasma/Libs/|.

The HDF5 library is required for modern I/O of NEO-2. One advantage over
text files is that each variable (dataset) has a unique name and can
store additional attributes such as units or comments. The usage of HDF5
was unavoidable for storing the large datasets that occur when computing
the generalized Spitzer function for stellarators. In order to simplify
the calls a collection of wrapper routines has been created. This
project has grown over the time so that it was decided to use these
wrapper functions also in other projects, as in the interface, so that
it became an own library called \vv{hdf5tools}.

For parallelization the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used. The
usage of MPI in NEO-2 is performed via an own library, called MyMPILib,
and is not restricted to a particular MPI implementation. At our
institute it is linked against OpenMPI, where on clusters Intel MPI is
mostly used. MyMPILib was developed so that in the code of NEO-2 no
native MPI commands have to be used.

Note that it was decided to no longer have \vv{hdf5tools} and
\vv{MyMPILib} as separate libraries, but to add them to \vv{libneo},
which is intended to collect code that is used by multiple programs of
the group. \vv{libneo} is also available from github.

\section{Running an ECCD precomputation}
\subsection{Preparations}
To run NEO-2 with a Boozer file as input for the magnetic equilibrium,
the following input files are required:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \vv{neo.in}
 \item \vv{neo2.in}
 \item Boozer file (*.bc)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{neo.in}
The first line of this file indicates the name of the Boozer file. Other
parameters are e.g. related to interpolation of the magnetic field
module and to the code NEO.

\subsubsection{neo2.in}
This file is a Fortran namelist file. It contains physical input
quantities and a lot of numerical and technical parameters. Here, the
most important (and new) parameters are described.
Check also \vv|neo2.in.par-full| in the DOC folder of the NEO-2
repository. The file should contain an up-to-date list of all the input
parameters together with a short explanation.

Note on naming convention: the prefix lsw and isw stand for logical
switch and integer switch, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb|boozer_s| \newline
 Defines the flux surface as normalized toroidal flux.
 \item \verb|conl_over_mfp|\newline
 This is the collisionality parameter. When provided positive it is
 $L_c/l_c$ (connection length over mean free path) and when provided as
 negative value it is $\kappa = 2/l_c$. Please be aware that in our
 papers we define $\kappa = 1/l_c$, while internally in NEO-2 it has a
 slightly different normalization.
 \item \verb|mag_nperiod_min|\newline
 Only used for stellarators. Defines the minimum number of field periods
 until the field line is closed artificially.
\end{itemize}

New parameters related to the collision operator:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb|lag|\newline
 Number of basis functions (former: number of Laguerre polynomials)
 \item \verb|leg|\newline
 Number of Legendre polynomials
 \item \verb|T_e|\newline
 Electron temperature for relativistic collision operator in eV.
 \item \verb|isw_relativistic|
 \begin{itemize}
  \item 0: Non-relativistic limit (Default)
  \item 1: Braams/Karney model. If $leg>1$, then higher Legendre
  polynomials are computed in the non-relativistic limit.
  \item 2: Direct evaluation of Beliaev/Budker form.
 \end{itemize}
 \item \verb|v_max_resolution|\newline
 Only affects level placement and defines the maximum normalized
 velocity that should be resolved by the grid. Experience showed that
 values of $2$ - $3$ are sufficient for reconstruction of the
 generalized Spitzer function up to $5$ times the thermal velocity.
 \item \verb|collop_base_prj|\newline
 Projection base for basis function expansion.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item 0: Generalized Laguerre polynomials of order $3/2$ (Default).
  \item 1: Standard polynomials $\phi_m(x) = x^m$.
  \item 2: Quadratic polynomials $\phi_m(x) = x^{2m}$.
  \item 10: Cubic Splines generated from a $y_m = (0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0)$ grid.
  \item 11: General B-Splines (best choice).
 \end{itemize}

 \item \verb|collop_base_exp|\newline
 Expansion base for basis function expansion. See \verb|collop_base_prj|
 for parameters. At the moment it was only tested for
 \verb|collop_base_prj = collop_base_exp|.

 \item \verb|collop_bspline_order|\newline
 According to the B-Spline definition this is the order parameter $k$.
 As an example $k=3$ creates quadratic B-Splines and $k=4$ cubic
 B-Splines (best choice).

 \item \verb|collop_bspline_dist|\newline
 This parameter was introduces for testing a non-uniform knot
 distribution for B-Splines. Default value is $1$ which defines a
 uniform knot distribution (best choice).

 \item \verb|phi_x_max|\newline
 Important parameter for numerical integration and definition of
 B-Spline knot distribution. The B-Splines are distributed between
 $x=0$ and this value. A typical choice is $5$. Above this value the
 B-Splines are extrapolated with a Taylor series.

 \item \vv{mag_write_hdf5}\newline
 Creates \vv{magnetic.h5} which contains all information of the magnetic
 field as it is ``seen'' from NEO-2.

 \item \vv{lsw_save_dentf}, \vv{lsw_save_enetf}, \vv{lsw_save_spitf}\newline
 Defines if the gradient driven distribution function (mainly used for
 bootstrap studies) or the generalized Spitzer function is stored. These
 settings of course require NEO-2 reconstruction runs.

 \item \vv{prop_reconstruct}\newline
 0 means a standard NEO-2 run. If \vv{prop_write = 2}, then all
 information for subsequent reconstruction runs are stored. For full
 reconstruction NEO-2 has to be run all reconstruction steps from 0 to
 3, where 3 is a service run which cleans up the directory and merges
 all HDF5 files. Note that for the parallelized stellarator version only
 reconstruction steps 0 and 2 can be parallelized with MPI.

\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preparation of equilibrium}
The main directory for everything related to ECCD is
\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/}. The Boozer files for ECCD runs are
located here: \vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Boozer/}.

Usually the W7-X files are already in the correct format to be read by
NEO-2 despite of some additional comment lines at the beginning of the
file which can be safely removed. An example of the original file and
the slightly modified file (some comments have been removed) is given
here: \vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Boozer/w7x-m111-b3-i1/}.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preparation of the plasma parameter profiles}
The profiles for ECCD can be found here:
\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Profiles/}. Profiles are usually
provided as text files, e.g.,
\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Profiles/w7x-m111-b3-i1/prf.txt}. These
plasma parameter profiles are used for computation of the collisionality
parameter $\kappa$, which is then used as an input to NEO-2. Please note
that the collisionality is a function of the flux surface label. For the
converter is it necessary that the file has the appropriate format and
the that units are correct. A MATLAB script is given in the file
\vv{convert_prf.m}, while it should be noted that the reader section of
this script is adapted for one particular input file format. The output
file has to have the form of
\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Profiles/w7x-m111-b3-i1/profiles.dat}.
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1. Column: Normalized toroidal flux (\vv{boozer_s}).
 \item 2. Column: Electron density in cm$^{-3}$.
 \item 3. Column: Electron temperature in eV.
 \item 4. Column: Effective charge $Z_\mathrm{eff}$.
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preparation of the run directories}
Next step is the preparation of the flux surface grid for the NEO-2
runs. It is started from an uniform grid where each grid point is
slightly shifted if a low-order rational flux surface is detected.
Afterwards the given profile file is read for computation of the
collisionality parameter (by spline interpolation along the radial
coordinate).

It is now necessary to copy the following required files to to an new
empty directory, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Boozer/w7x-m24li/w7x-m24li.bc .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Profiles/w7x-m24li/nT_profiles_from_TCode-mod.dat .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Magfie/Boozer/w7x-m24li/s025/neo.in .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Create_Surfaces/create_surfaces.in .
ln -s /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Create_Surfaces/Build/create_surfaces.x
\end{verbatim}

The namelist file \vv{create_surfaces.in} is described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \vv{s_beg} \newline
 First flux surface (normalized toroidal flux)
 \item \vv{s_end} \newline
 Last flux surface (normalized toroidal flux)
 \item \vv{s_steps} \newline
 Number of flux surfaces
 \item \vv{mag_nperiod_min} \newline
 Minimum number of toroidal field periods
 \item \vv{mag_nperiod_max} \newline
 Maximum number of toroidal field periods (required for avoiding
 low-order rational flux surfaces)
 \item \vv{output_file} \newline
 Output file with input parameters for NEO-2
 \item \vv{isw_create_surfaces} \newline
 Defines if flux surfaces should be found for NEO-2 runs or if only the
 plasma parameter profiles should be splined (Default: true)
 \item \vv{profiles_file} \newline
 Input file for plasma parameter profiles (as it was generated in the
 last step)
\end{itemize}

Running \vv{./create_surfaces.x} creates a grid in \vv{boozer_s} that
fulfills the properties as defined in the config file. Afterwards a
spline interpolation is used to compute the collisionality parameter per
flux surface. The file \vv{surfaces.dat} (as defined by \vv{output_file}
in the config file) is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1. Column: \vv{boozer_s}
 \item 2. Column: \vv{conl_over_mfp} (negative because this is $\kappa$
 as used in NEO-2)
 \item 3. Column: \vv{Z_eff}
 \item 4. Column: \vv{T_e} (Electron temperature in eV)
\end{itemize}

Please note that the code for creating the surfaces allows for some
surfaces to have more periods than defined in \vv{mag_nperiod_max} in
order to not shift this surface to far away from the original
equidistant grid.

In the next step a template directory for the run directories has to be
created. Here, an example of \vv{neo2.in} is used and the executable of
NEO-2 is copied from the project directory. Please note that in the
\vv{neo2.in} file the correct placeholders have to be defined before
running the next script.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir TEMPLATE_DIR
cd TEMPLATE_DIR
cp ../w7x-m24li.bc .
cp ../neo.in .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Code/Neo2-MODULAR/NEO-2-PAR/Build-Debug/neo_2.x .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Examples/neo2.in .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Examples/condor-all.submit .
\end{verbatim}

The last line is only used if HTCondor should be used as batch system.
Next, the code
\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Create_Surfaces/create_surf.py} has to
be started, in the parent directory of the template directory:
\begin{verbatim}
ln -s /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Create_Surfaces/create_surf.py .
./create_surf.py
\end{verbatim}

This has created \vv{s_steps} directories, each with an modified
\vv{neo2.in} file. It is recommended to change into one of these
directories and to check if \vv{boozer_s}, \vv{conl_over_mfp}, and
\vv{z_eff} have been set correctly. The Python script has an output
representing the directory names that have been created. These names
should now be copied into a file named \vv{jobs_list.txt}.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Running the jobs}
In order to start the jobs the script
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Examples/run_condor.sh condor-all.submit
\end{verbatim}
can be used, which submits a condor job for each directory given in
\vv{jobs_list.txt}. Checking the output of \vv{condor_q} shows the
number of submitted Condor jobs.

Another approach would be to use a condor submit file similar to
\vv{condor_submit_example} in the DOC folder of the neo-2 repository.
While the above will create one ``batch'' per subfolder, the
example file would create one ``batch'' in total, which has one job per
subfolder.
It can be used with
\begin{verbatim}
condor_submit condor_submit_example
\end{verbatim}

As soon as the jobs have finished, the code
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/h5merge/Build/h5merge.x
\end{verbatim}
has to be run. This code merges the output file of NEO-2 \vv{final.h5}
of each directory defined in \vv{jobs_list.txt} into one output file.
This output is file is already the one which is used by the NEO-2/TRAVIS
interface.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Studies of the generalized Spitzer function}
For this is it necessary that for at least one flux surface the file
\vv{final.h5} had been produced with a NEO-2 run.

The best option is the create a plot-directory inside of the run
directory of NEO-2:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir PLOTS
cd PLOTS
ln -s /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Spitzer_Interface/Build/neo2_g.x
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Examples/g_vs_lambda.in .
cp /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Examples/spitzerinterface.in .
./neo2_g.x
\end{verbatim}

The config files are defined in the technical documentation of the
interface\footnote{\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Documentation/Internal/Interface.pdf}}.
The result file (\vv{g_vs_lambda.h5}) can be plotted with MATLAB, e.g.,
with \vv{plot_g_xfix.m} from the main directory of all MATLAB scripts
related to ECCD:
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Matlab
\end{verbatim}

Please note that the information about the magnetic field is stored per
NEO-2 run in \vv{magnetics.h5} (only NEO-2-PAR has support for this).
This file can also be used to plot the field module along the field line
for visualization of the observations points. A useful MATLAB script is
\vv{plot_levels_pgf.m} which also exports the correct format for
\vv{g_vs_lambda.in}.

Further plots of the magnetic field, such as a 2D distribution of the
magnetic field module on a particular flux surface can be made with the
tools located here:
\begin{verbatim}
 /proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Magfie
\end{verbatim}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Running TRAVIS}
TRAVIS is located here:
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/TRAVIS
\end{verbatim}
In order to start the GUI the following steps are necessary:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \vv{/proj/plasma/TRAVIS/TRAVIS-16-04-08/bin/bin_ECRH/travisGUI64_IOTA}
 \item Say yes to the question if the last project should be loaded.
 \item Preferences -> Advanced -> Expert mode
 \item On the top right corner select the TRAVIS kernel for your demands
 (SYNCH, NEO-2 non-rel, NEO-2 rel, pure TRAVIS)
\end{itemize}

The configuration with HDF5 input file for the interface is used has to
be set in the usual \vv{spitzerinterface.in} file which is located in
the RUN/TEMP directory of TRAVIS. This can also be selected in the
settings of TRAVIS. If there is an upgrade to the NEO-2 interface or to
SYNCH, the TRAVIS kernels have to be recompiled. This has to be done
here:
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/TRAVIS/TRAVIS-16-04-08/TRAVIS-src
\end{verbatim}
with the command \vv{make gnu}. However, before several config files
have to be set, especially, \vv{makeunix/mkfiles/defs.mk}.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Bootstrap}
For plotting the bootstrap coefficient it is not necessary to run NEO-2
in the reconstruction mode. Plotting can be done with the script
\vv{/proj/plasma/DOCUMENTS/PHD_Gernot/2017_BOOTSTRAP/plot_evolve_h5.m}.
This script has to be started in the directory where the complete NEO-2
run is located.

For investigating the gradient driven distribution it is necessary to
complete a full reconstruction run of NEO-2 (steps 0 to 3). Then one can
use the MATLAB scripts from
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/DOCUMENTS/PHD_Gernot/2017_BOOTSTRAP
\end{verbatim}
in order to evaluate the antisymmetric part of the gradient driven
distribution function at various observation points. The script
\vv{count_maxima_bootstrap.m} is a good place to start with.

This script reads the file \vv{magnetics.h5} from the run directory of
NEO-2 and shows a part of the field line. The variable \vv{point_phimfl}
defines the angle along the field line defining the observation point
indicated as dot in the figure. The MATLAB script has an output on the
console of the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
                  s              theta                phi     tag
     2.50000000e-01     4.43238764e+00     5.98323740e+00      p1
\end{verbatim}

This is the input for the NEO-2 interface computing the distribution
function at the defined observation point(s).

A good start for beginning is with LHD runs for the bootstrap tasks, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
/temp/gernot_k/Neo2/RunsByDate/2017_07_Bootstrap/lhd/
Short/conl_over_mfp=5m5-boozer_s=0.25d0-mag_nperiod_min=1-bsfunc_local_err=1m1
\end{verbatim}
In the subdirectory \vv{PLOTS} a symbolic link to the distribution
function plotter for bootstrap is already prepared
(\vv{/proj/plasma/Neo2/Interface/Spitzer_Interface/Build/dentf_lorentz.x}).
Please note that this executable is slightly different to \vv{neo2_g.x}
as used for Spitzer function, because a significant higher number of
$x$-values (velocity module) are used for plotting. In
\vv{g_vs_lambda.in} the two lines from the output of the MATLAB script
should be inserted. Next, \vv{./dentf_lorentz.x} can be run in the
\vv{../PLOTS} directory. This produces \vv{g_vs_lambda.h5} (as before
for ECCD tasks). Finally, the MATLAB script from before can be run a
second time and the distribution function including the relevant maxima
is plotted.

Please note, that if the observation point is changed,
\vv{./dentf_lorentz.x} has to be run again with an updated input file.
Otherwise, the MATALB plotter will show data from the previous run of
the interface.

The settings in \vv{spitzerinterface.in} are described in the interface
documentation. It should be noted that the parameter \vv{plot_source}
can have the values \vv{dentf}, \vv{enetf}, and \vv{spitf} defining the
distribution function to be plotted.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scripts for running the jobs in Condor}
In
\begin{verbatim}
/proj/plasma/DOCUMENTS/PHD_Gernot/2017_BOOTSTRAP
\end{verbatim}
there are two important scripts which are useful for running many
instances of NEO-2 at the same time via Condor.

The script \vv{create_dirs_paramvalue.sh} reads a file called
\vv{dirs_list.txt} and copies from a directory \vv{TEMPLATE_DIR} all
files to given subdirectories and modifies each \vv{neo2.in}. It is best
explained by looking at some examples, e.g., here:
\begin{verbatim}
/temp/gernot_k/Neo2/RunsByDate/2017_07_Bootstrap/ratfieldline
\end{verbatim}

For running the jobs the same script can be used as introduced in the
ECCD section of this writeup (\vv{run_condor.sh}). Here, the content of
the condor submission file is described in more detail:
\begin{verbatim}
Executable = NEO2-all.sh
Universe   = vanilla

Error      = NEO2-0.e$(Cluster)
Log        = NEO2-0.l$(Cluster)
Output     = NEO2-0.o$(Cluster)

notification = Never

request_cpus   = 4

The first line defines the executable which has to be located in
\vv{/temp/} because Condor does not have access to AFS. The Universe
defines the Condor environment and is always vanilla at our institute.
The next three lines define the file names for the output files, where
(\$Cluster) will be an ID which is created by Condor defining the job.
The notification line defines if a mail is sent when the job has
finished.

The launch script \vv{NEO2-all.sh} (located in the template directories)
is written in a way that MPI is used for running NEO-2. Here, the number
of processors used is given by \vv{request_cpus} in the Condor
submission file. In the vanilla universe it is not possible to run the
MPI jobs across machines so that a typical number is 4 to 8 at our
institute. The requested memory (30*1024 = 30 GB) defines how much
memory the job will need (all MPI processes together). This is not an
upper limit, it only is used for Condor deciding on which machine the
job will run. If the job will e.g. run on 50 GB machine it is no problem
if the jobs requires e.g. 40 GB. However, if the same job runs on a
32 GB machine then \vv{neo_2.x} will crash and the requested memory
should be increased so that the job is distributed to a machine with
more memory. If Condor jobs are failing then one should look into the
file NEO-2.e(\$SomeNumber) because there the error messages are located.
Some IEEE underflow errors are "normal" at the moment. They arise from
some underflow during the integration of the matrix elements and might
be fixed in the future.

The rest of the lines does not have to be changed except one would like
to exclude a special machine from Condor.
If your jobs fits into the memory of regular machines, then you should
exclude the high memory machines (e.g. faepop12 and faepop13), so as to
not block them for people who need the memory.

\subsection{Boozer file for rational field line}
For creating a magnetic equilibrium with toroidal perturbations, the
following MATLAB script can be used:
\vv{/proj/plasma/DOCUMENTS/PHD_Gernot/2017_BOOTSTRAP/boozer_rational.m}

This script starts from \vv{tok-synch2.bc}, adds a perturbation field
with given mode number and perturbation amplitude. In addition, a flat
rotational transform profile can be created.

Running the script \vv{plot_evolve_h5.m} in the parent directory
containing the run directories, plots the bootstrap coefficient. Using
\vv{/proj/plasma/DOCUMENTS/PHD_Gernot/2017_BOOTSTRAP/plot_levels.m} in a
specific run directory (containing \vv{magnetics.h5}) plots the magnetic
field module along the field line with level distribution.
