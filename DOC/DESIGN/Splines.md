# Spline Coefficients Module Analysis

## Overview

The `COMMON/spline_cof.f90` module provides spline interpolation functionality for NEO-2. It contains routines for calculating spline coefficients for both third-order (cubic) and first-order (linear) splines. The module has recently been enhanced with a fast implementation for natural cubic splines with uniform lambda weights.

## Module Structure

### Main Components

1. **fastspline module** (lines 20-67)
   - Contains `splinecof3_fast` - an efficient implementation for natural cubic splines
   - Uses LAPACK's `dptsv` for solving tridiagonal systems

2. **Third-order spline routines**
   - `splinecof3_a` (lines 112-650) - General cubic spline with test function, LSQ, smoothing
   - `reconstruction3_a` (lines 662-684) - Reconstruct spline coefficients
   - `splinecof3_lo_driv_a` (lines 715-868) - Driver for splinecof3
   - `splinecof3_hi_driv_a` (lines 889-955) - High-level driver

3. **First-order spline routines**
   - `splinecof1_a` (lines 1061-1165) - Linear interpolation
   - `reconstruction1_a` (lines 1177-1194) - Reconstruct linear coefficients
   - `splinecof1_lo_driv_a` (lines 1225-1376) - Driver for splinecof1
   - `splinecof1_hi_driv_a` (lines 1397-1461) - High-level driver

4. **Utility routines**
   - `calc_opt_lambda3_a` (lines 960-1013) - Calculate optimal smoothing weights
   - `dist_lin_a` (lines 1016-1034) - Distance calculation for smoothing

## Current Implementation Details

### splinecof3_a (General Case)

The general cubic spline implementation constructs a large sparse matrix of size `(7*len_indx - 2) × (7*len_indx - 2)` where:
- 7 variables per interval (VAR = 7)
- The matrix includes constraints for:
  - Boundary conditions (2 equations)
  - Continuity conditions (A_i, B_i, C_i)
  - Least squares fitting with optional smoothing
  - Test function f(x) with power m

The system is solved using `sparse_solve` from `sparse_mod`, which can use different backends (SuperLU, SuiteSparse).

### splinecof3_fast (Optimized Case)

The fast implementation is used when:
- `m == 0` (no test function)
- `sw1 == 2 && sw2 == 4` (natural boundary conditions)
- `c1 == 0 && cn == 0` (zero second derivatives at boundaries)
- All `lambda1 == 1.0` (no smoothing)

It directly constructs and solves a tridiagonal system of size `(n-2) × (n-2)` using LAPACK's `dptsv`.

## Dependencies

### Modules that depend on spline_cof.f90:
1. `COMMON/inter_interfaces.f90` - Provides interfaces
2. `COMMON/neo_sub.f90` - Uses spline routines
3. `COMMON/collop_spline.f90` - Collision operator splines
4. `NEO-2-QL/neo_magfie_perturbation.f90` - Magnetic field perturbations
5. `tools/create_surfaces/src/nfp.f90` - Surface creation
6. `tools/create_surfaces/src/create_surfaces.f90` - Surface creation

### Modules that spline_cof.f90 depends on:
1. `nrtype` - Type definitions (I4B, DP)
2. `inter_interfaces` - Function interfaces (calc_opt_lambda3, dist_lin, splinecof3, etc.)
3. `sparse_mod` - Sparse matrix solver (sparse_solve)
4. LAPACK - `dptsv` routine for tridiagonal systems

## Feasibility of Banded Matrix Approach

### Current Bottleneck

The general `splinecof3_a` routine constructs a large sparse matrix with dimension `7*(number of intervals) - 2`. For many flux surfaces (>1000), this becomes computationally expensive due to:
1. Memory allocation for the full matrix
2. Sparse solver overhead
3. Matrix assembly time

### Opportunities for Banded Matrix Optimization

1. **Natural cubic splines** (already implemented in `splinecof3_fast`)
   - Uses tridiagonal (bandwidth=1) system
   - Direct LAPACK solver `dptsv`
   - Significant performance improvement

2. **General cubic splines with specific boundary conditions**
   - The matrix structure shows a banded pattern with bandwidth ~7
   - Most non-zero elements are near the diagonal
   - Boundary conditions add some fill-in at corners

3. **Cases amenable to banded approach:**
   - When `m == 0` (no test function) - reduces to standard spline problem
   - When smoothing is uniform (`lambda` constant)
   - Standard boundary conditions (not mixed periodic/non-periodic)

4. **Challenging cases for banded approach:**
   - Non-zero test function `f(x,m)` with `m ≠ 0`
   - Variable smoothing weights
   - Complex boundary condition combinations
   - The least-squares formulation with point skipping (`w` array)

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate optimization**: Already done with `splinecof3_fast` for the most common case

2. **Next steps for further optimization**:
   - Identify other common parameter combinations that could use banded solvers
   - Consider pentadiagonal or heptadiagonal solvers for slightly more general cases
   - Profile to determine which parameter combinations are most frequently used

3. **Long-term considerations**:
   - The general formulation with test functions and smoothing may inherently require sparse solvers
   - Consider restructuring the problem formulation to maintain bandedness
   - Investigate whether the least-squares approach can be reformulated

## Matrix Structure Analysis

The general matrix has the following structure:
- Row 1: Boundary condition 1
- Rows 2-7: First interval constraints
- Rows 8-14, 15-21, ...: Subsequent interval constraints  
- Last row: Boundary condition 2

Each interval contributes 7 equations:
1. A_i: Continuity of function value
2. B_i: Continuity of first derivative
3. C_i: Continuity of second derivative
4. δa_i: Least squares for function values
5. δb_i: Least squares for first derivatives
6. δc_i: Least squares for second derivatives
7. δΔd_i: Smoothing constraint on third derivative

The coupling between intervals is limited, suggesting a banded structure is possible for many cases.
