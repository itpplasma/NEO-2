\paragraph{boozer}
Read in subroutine \codevariable{neo\_read} in \file{neo\_sub.f90} (only
the axisymetric part?).

\paragraph{efit}
Efit files are read in \file{field\_divB0} in the routines
\codevariable{read\_dimeq1} (basic size information) and
\codevariable{read\_eqfile1} (all the data, and again the basic size
information).

For efit case, input is assumed to be in SI units. The subroutine
\codevariable{field\_eq} (which calls the reading routines above), will
then convert the values to CGS units.

\paragraph{neo.in}
A fixed format file.

Read in subroutine \codevariable{neo\_read\_control} in
\file{neo\_sub.f90}.

\paragraph{neo2.in}
A namelist file.
Read in main file.

Memory scales at least with cube of lag parameter, as the number of
non-zero elements of the sparse matrix scales with the cube of number of
basis polynoms.
