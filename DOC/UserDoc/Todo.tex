\section{Computation of $E_r$ for non-Boozer coordinates}
The computation of the radial electromagnetic field and some related
quantities in \file{ntv\_mod.f90}, subroutine
\codevariable{compute\_Er\_a} is so far only implemented for Boozer
coordinates.
The computation for other coordinates (should be so far only cylindrical
coordinates?), should also be implemented, as these quantity (and
related quantities) might be of interest for the computation of fluxes.
