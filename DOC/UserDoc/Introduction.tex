\chapter{Introduction}
This document is intended as documentation on how to use neo-2 and also
give some theoretical background.

Neo-2 is an expansion of neo. It computes fluxes of a plasmas in a
fusion device (tokamak or stellerator). This includes momentum fluxes,
required for the computation of toroidal torque.
There are currently many variants of the code. In this repository are
two of them located,  one that specialises in stellerators and
unperturbed tokamaks, with the possibility to make relativistic
calculations.
The other variant focuses on perturbed tokamaks, with the possibility to
treat multispecies plasmas.
A complete list of the input parameters, together with some
documentation can be found in the DOC directory for both variants of the
code.
