This section aims at listing the dependencies, and giving some
background on where there are used and how they are included in the
code.

\subsection{GSL/FGSL}
Then gnu scientific library is used via the fortran wrapper fgsl. The
fgsl in turn is wrapped by neo-2. Only those files which actually use
the fgsl code directly are compiled with the necessary include
information.
Currently besselfunction, numerical rootfinding, numerical integration
and bsplines are used by \neotwo.
