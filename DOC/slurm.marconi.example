# Example script on how to submit neo-2 with slurm on marconi cluster.
# Usage:
# sbatch slurm.marconi.example
#
# Note that lines with #SBATCH are _not_ comments.

# Name of the job
#SBATCH --job-name=NEO-2-W7X
# Number of nodes
#SBATCH --nodes=1
# Number of tasks per node
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24

# Which partition, consider website for possible values, this also
# depends on which project you belong to.
#SBATCH --partition=skl_fua_prod

# Not used/needed?
#  SBATCH --qos=normal_0064

# Time limit, for the partition used here 24 h should be the maximum.
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
# Which account(=project?) will be billed for the time.
# Note that this is not the user. A single user can belong to multiple
# accounts, and an account can have multiple users.
#SBATCH --account=FUA35_TSVVSTOP

# Where to place standard and error output.
#SBATCH --err=NEO-2-W7X.err
#SBATCH	--out=NEO-2-W7X.out

# Export variable, to restrict number of omp processes.
# Used by libraries?
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

# Set variable for use in this script.

# Actual commands to run.
# In this case full run, therefore the sed, to change the value of
# prop_reconstruction.
# Note that steps 1 and 3 are not parallelized.
