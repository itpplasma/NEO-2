v0.1

Old stable version.

Version used for example by Matyas.

Code has been in use much longer, so setting this as 0.1 is probably not
justified, but I do not know enough about the code to give a more
meaningfull version number.

v0.1.1

Stable version used for a publication.

This version of the code is tagged because it was used for a publication
and should be easily acessible.

Again, the depicting this as 0.1.1 might be quesionable, but as the
tagger does not know any better, and was told that from 0.1 to this
commit there where not much physical additions*, this was chosen.

*Was the relativistic part already earlier? yes
