1. Copy the file
   BuildConfig.sample
   to
   BuildConfig.txt
   and customize the environment and compiler settings.   

2. For more customization of the build-process edit
   CMakeLists.txt
   .
   
3. If you have changed the files, then call
   rm CMakeCache.txt
   rm -r CMakeFiles/
   in order to ensure that the files are re-read by cmake.
   
4. Run 
   cmake .
   to let cmake create a make-file for the environment.
  
5. Run 
   make or make.openmpi (on ITP-Cluster).
